# Sound card names:
#
# In PortAudio, soundcards have an index number 0, 1, 2, ... and a name.
# The name can be something like "HDA NVidia: AD198x Analog (hw:0,0)" or
# "surround41".  In Quisk, all PortAudio device names start with "portaudio".
# A device name like "portaudio#6" directly specifies the index.  A name like
# "portaudio:text" means to search for "text" in all available devices.  And
# there is a default device "portaudiodefault".  So these portaudio names are useful:
#name_of_sound_capt = "portaudio:(hw:0,0)"		# First sound card
#name_of_sound_capt = "portaudio:(hw:1,0)"		# Second sound card, etc.
#name_of_sound_capt = "portaudio#1"				# Directly specified index
#name_of_sound_capt = "portaudiodefault"		# May give poor performance on capture
#
# In ALSA, soundcards have these names.  The "hw" devices are the raw
# hardware devices, and should be used for soundcard capture.
#name_of_sound_capt = "hw:0"					# First sound card
#name_of_sound_capt = "hw:1"					# Second sound card, etc.
#name_of_sound_capt = "plughw"
#name_of_sound_capt = "plughw:1"
#name_of_sound_capt = "default"
#
# It is usually best to use ALSA names because they provide minimum latency.  But
# you may need to use PulseAudio to connect to other programs such as wsjt-x.
#
# Pulseaudio support was added by Philip G. Lee.  Many thanks!
# More pulse audio support was added by Eric Thornton, KM4DSJ.  Many thanks!
#
# For PulseAudio devices, use the name "pulse:name" and connect the streams
# to your hardware devices using a PulseAudio control program.  The name "pulse"
# alone refers to the "default" device.  The PulseAudio names are quite long;
# for example "alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo".  Look on the screen
# Config/Sound to see the device names.  There is a description, a PulseAudio name,
# and for ALSA devices, the ALSA name.  An example is:
#
#   CM106 Like Sound Device Analog Stereo
#      alsa_output.usb-0d8c_USB_Sound_Device-00-Device.analog-stereo
#      USB Sound Device USB Audio (hw:1,0)
#
#  Instead of the long PulseAudio name, you can enter a substring of any of
#  these three strings.
#
# Use the default pulse device for radio sound:
#name_of_sound_play = "pulse"
# Use a PulseAudio name for radio sound:
#name_of_sound_play = "pulse:alsa_output.usb-0d8c_USB_Sound_Device-00-Device.analog-stereo"
# Abbreviate the PulseAudio name:
#name_of_sound_play = "pulse:alsa_output.usb"
# Another abbreviation:
#name_of_sound_play = "pulse:CM106"
